- Copy the code to the clipboard.
- Save the code to a file.
- Lock/unlock the code editor for editing.
- Code execution and rendering in an iframe.

## Usage

1. Select a programming language from the dropdown to specify the language for your code.
2. Write your code in the code editor.
3. Use the "Run" button to execute the code. The output will be displayed in the iframe.
4. You can copy the code to your clipboard using the "Copy" button.
5. Use the "Save" button to save the code to a file with the appropriate file extension.
6. The "Lock" and "Unlock" button allows you to toggle between read-only and edit mode.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Monaco Editor for code editing
- react-copy-to-clipboard for copying code

## instruction Follow In Detail- 


how the code follows the given instructions:

1. Copy Button: The code includes a "Copy" button using the react-copy-to-clipboard library, which allows users to copy the code to their clipboard. When the "Copy" button is clicked, it triggers the handleCopyClick function and shows an alert message.

2. Save Button: The code features a "Save" button, which allows users to save the code as a file with an appropriate file extension based on the selected language. The code correctly creates a Blob, generates a download link, and triggers a click event on an anchor element to save the file.

3. Lock/Unlock Button: The "Lock/Unlock" button toggles between "Lock" and "Unlock" based on the state of the isLocked variable. Clicking the button triggers the toggleLock function, which toggles the isLocked state.

4. Basic Features of Indentation: The code handles the Tab key press to prevent default tab behavior, which is a basic feature of indentation.

5. Properly Formatted Code: The code is well-structured and formatted, with comments explaining the purpose of various functions and code blocks.

6. CSS Styling: The code uses CSS for styling, and it is organized using the BEM methodology.

7. Programming Languages Selection: The code allows users to select different programming languages (HTML, JavaScript, Python) through a dropdown menu.

8. Execution of Code: The code features a "Run" button (function__run_btn) that runs the code in an iframe, displaying the output based on the selected language. The output is properly displayed in an iframe.

9. Code Editing: The code editor itself is implemented using the MonacoEditor component, allowing users to type and edit code.

10. Functionality Testing: It appears that the code is designed to meet the functionality requirements. The buttons have click event handlers that perform their respective tasks.
